 ## Project: Etch-a-Sketch ‚úèÔ∏è(Foundations Course, The Odin Project) ##

# Project Outline/Objective*: #
Create a browser-based sketch pad built with JavaScript and Flexbox with the following guidance:
- Generate a dynamic grid of square divs (default 16√ó16) inside a container
- Use Flexbox for layout‚Äîno CSS Grid allowed!
- Adds hover effect to simulate drawing with the mouse
- Includes a button to resize the grid (up to 100√ó100) via user input
- Maintains consistent canvas size regardless of number of pixels

# Notes on Using AI for this Project:
Although I never just copy and paste code from AI, I have historically used it as a teacher to help me work through difficulties in code. However, I am pleased to say that I found a noticeable difference this time around in the quantity of times I used AI for problem solving or generating initial code. I attribute this to defaulting a lot more to using web tools to see errors in the console and using console.log more accurately to understand where the breaks in logic are. I am also becoming more trusitng in finding the answer through resources such as Stack OverFlow as I become more confident in knowing and articulating what I am trying to find out. 

In this project, I have used MicroSoft CoPilot for the following:
- Trouble shoot why my grid was only appending one square initially. 
- Learning how to properly reference links in Markdown on LEARNINGLOG. 
- Understanding some of the correct conventional commit structures for gitHub.
- Reformatting (NOT rewriting) my LEARNING LOG into a concise structure. 
- Summarising the initial TOP instructions for the README document.
